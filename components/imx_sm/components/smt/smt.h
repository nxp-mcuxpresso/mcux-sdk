/*!
 * Configure an SMT channel.
 *
 * @param[in]     smtChannel  Channel for comms
 * @param[in]     mbInst      Mailbox instance
 * @param[in]     mbDoorbell  Doorbell index
 * @param[in]     sma         Shared memory address
 *
 * This function configures an SMT channel for client use. The \a
 * smtChannel parameter is the channel to configure. It is then used
 * for following calls to the SCMI API.
 *
 * The \a mbInst and \a mbDoorbell parameters depend on the kind of
 * mailbox used. For an MU, \a mbInst is the index into the SDK MU_BASE_PTRS
 * array. The \a mbDoorbell is the MU GI to use to trigger an interrupt
 * response.
 *
 * The \a sma parameter is the address of the shared memory area. For MUs with
 * an internal 1K SRAM, a value of 0 indicates to use that (128K per channel
 * spaced in order of doorbell).
 *
 * Note the SYstem Manager (SM) configuration will determine which MU is used
 * for a client and which doorbells are associated with A2P channels, P2A
 * notification channels, and FuSa notification channels.
 *
 * @return Returns the status (::SCMI_ERR_SUCCESS = success).
