Overview
========
The FTM project is a demonstration program of the SDK FTM driver's input capture feature.
The example sets up a FTM channel for dual-edge capture. Once the input signal is received,
this example will print the capture value.

Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  9.3.1
- MCUXpresso  11.3.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- FRDM-KE06Z board
- Personal Computer
- Oscilloscope

Board settings
==============
This example project does not call for any special hardware configurations.
Although not required, the recommendation is to leave the development board's jumper settings
and configurations in default state when running this example.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a USB cable between the host PC and the OpenSDA USB port on the target board.
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4. Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the example.

Running the demo
================
- Use Oscilloscope to output signal to PTC0 (J3-4).
- These results are displayed/shown on the terminal window:

Once the input signal is received the input capture value is printed

Capture value C(n)V=32c(*)

(*) This value maybe difference, depend on input signal.
