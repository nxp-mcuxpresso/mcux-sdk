Overview
========
Memory-Mapped Cryptographic Acceleration Unit (MMCAU)

This project is a demonstration program that uses the KSDK software for encryption/decryption sample
data using AES-CBC, DES3-CBC and Hash algorithms MD5, SHA1 and SHA256.


Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  9.3.1
- MCUXpresso  11.3.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/Micro USB cable
- FRDM-K32L2A4S board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
No special is needed.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a mini USB cable between the PC host and the OpenSDA USB port on the board.
2.  Open a serial terminal on PC for OpenSDA serial device with these settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
When the example runs successfully, you can see the similar information from the terminal as below.

Testing input string:
          Once upon a midnight dreary,
           while I pondered weak and weary,
          Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,
          While I nodded,
           nearly napping,
           suddenly there came a tapping,
          As of some one gently rapping,
           rapping at my chamber doorIts some visitor,
           I muttered,
           tapping at my chamber doorOnly this,
           and nothing more.
