Overview
========
The lpuart_edma Ring Buffer Example project is to demonstrate usage of the KSDK lpuart driver.
In the example, a ring buffer will be used with EDMA enabled, data received will be stored in ring 
buffer first, while IDLE line was detected, routine will read out the received characters, and echo back
them to the terminal by using EDMA mode. so, you can see the your pressed characters on the terminal.

Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  9.3.1
- MCUXpresso  11.3.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini USB cable
- FRDM-K32L2A4S board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
No special is needed.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a mini USB cable between the PC host and the OpenSDA USB port on the board.
2.  Open a serial terminal on PC for OpenSDA serial device with these settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Reset the SoC and run the project.

Running the demo
================
When the demo runs successfully, the log would be seen on the OpenSDA terminal like:
