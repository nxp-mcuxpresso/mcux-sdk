Overview
========
The PWM project is a simple demonstration program of the SDK PWM driver.
The pulse width modulator (PWM) module contains PWM submodules, each of which is set up to control a single half-bridge power stage.
Fault channel support is provided. This PWM module can generate various switching patterns, including highly sophisticated waveforms.
It can be used to control all known Switched Mode Power Supplies (SMPS) topologies.

Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  9.3.1
- MCUXpresso  11.3.0

Board settings
==============

* Probe the pwm signal using an oscilloscope
  R782 need to be connected
 - At J19-2
 - At J19-3
 - At J17-4
 - At J17-6

Prepare the Demo
================
1. Connect a USB cable between the PC host and the OpenSDA USB port on the board.
2. Open a serial terminal with these settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3. Download the program to the target board.
4. Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the example.

Running the demo
================
When the example runs successfully, the following message is displayed in the terminal:

Note:
To debug in qspiflash, following steps are needed:
1. Select the flash target and compile.
3. Set the SW8: 1 off 2 off 3 on 4 off, then power on the board and connect USB cable to J41.
4. Start debugging in IDE.
   - Keil: Click "Download (F8)" to program the image to qspiflash first then clicking "Start/Stop Debug Session (Ctrl+F5)" to start debugging.
