Overview
========
The flexcan_loopback example shows how to use the loopback test mode to debug your CAN Bus design:

To demonstrates this example, only one board is needed. The example will config one FlexCAN Message
Buffer to Rx Message Buffer and the other FlexCAN Message Buffer to Tx Message Buffer with same ID.
After that, the example will send a CAN Message from the Tx Message Buffer to the Rx Message Buffer
through internal loopback interconnect and print out the Message payload to terminal.

Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  9.3.1
- MCUXpresso  11.3.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- FRDMK64F board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
No special is needed.

Prepare the Demo
================
1. Connect a USB cable between the PC host and the OpenSDA USB on the board.
2. Open a serial terminal on PC for OpenSDA serial device with these settings:
   - 115200 baud rate
   - 8 data bits
   - No parity
   - One stop bit
   - No flow control
3. Download the program to the target board.
4. Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running
   the example.

Running the demo
================
When the example runs successfully, following information can be seen on the OpenSDA terminal:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

==FlexCAN loopback example -- Start.==


Send message from MB8 to MB9

tx word0 = 0x11223344

tx word1 = 0x55667788


Receved message from MB9

rx word0 = 0x11223344

rx word1 = 0x55667788


==FlexCAN loopback example -- Finish.==
