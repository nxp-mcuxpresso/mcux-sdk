Overview
========
The uart_edma ring buffer example shows how to use uart driver with EDMA:

In this example, one uart instance connect to PC through uart, the board will
send back all characters that PC send to the board. And data from PC will be firstly 
stored to a ring buffer using EDMA methord, and than application will read the ring buffer 
in a certain time, such as 10ms. While data has already be stored in the ring buffer,
routine will send them back.

And the ring buffer is achieved based on the DMA's source address modulo feature, the base address
should be aligned to a 0-modulo-boundary.

Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  9.3.1
- MCUXpresso  11.3.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini USB cable
- FRDM-K64F board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
No special is needed.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a mini USB cable between the PC host and the OpenSDA USB port on the board.
2.  Open a serial terminal on PC for OpenSDA serial device with these settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Reset the SoC and run the project.

Running the demo
================
When the demo runs successfully, the log would be seen on the OpenSDA terminal like:
