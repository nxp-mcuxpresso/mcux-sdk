Overview
========
The GPIO Example project is a demonstration program that uses the KSDK software to manipulate the general-purpose
outputs. The example use LEDs and buttons to demonstrates GPIO API for port and pin manipulation (init, set,
clear, and toggle).



Toolchain supported
===================
- MCUXpresso  11.3.0
- GCC ARM Embedded  9.3.1

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- LPCXpresso54114 board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
This example project does not call for any special hardware configurations.
Although not required, the recommendation is to leave the development board's jumper settings
and configurations in default state when running this example.

Prepare the Demo
================
Connect a serial cable from the debug UART port of the board to the PC. Start Tera Term
(http://ttssh2.osdn.jp) and make a connection to the virtual serial port.

1. Start Tera Term
2. New connection -> Serial
3. Set appropriate COMx port (x is port number) in Port context menu. Number is provided by operation
   system and could be different from computer to computer. Select COM number related to virtual
   serial port. Confirm selected port by OK button.
4. Set following connection parameters in menu Setup->Serial port...
        Baud rate:    115200
        Data:         8
        Parity:       none
        Stop:         1
        Flow control: none
5.  Confirm selected parameters by OK button.


Running the demo
================
After the board is flashed the Tera Term will print message on terminal.

Example output:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 GPIO Driver example

 The LED is taking turns to shine.

 Standard port read: f9ffffff

 Masked port read: f9ff0000

 Port state: f9ffffff

 Port state: f9ffffff

 Port state: f9ffffff

 Port state: f9ffffff
 ...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- When press sw1 the LED GREEN will turn to shine and you can Probe oscilloscope at J9-8 to see output signal.
