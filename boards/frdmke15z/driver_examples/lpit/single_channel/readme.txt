Overview
========
The LPIT single channel project is a simple example of the SDK LPIT driver. It sets up the LPIT
hardware block to trigger a periodic interrupt after every 1 second. When the LPIT interrupt is triggered
a message a printed on the serial terminal and an LED is toggled on the board.


Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  9.3.1
- MCUXpresso  11.3.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- FRDM-KE15Z board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
No special settings are required.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a USB cable between the host PC and the OpenSDA USB port on the target board.
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
   - 115200 baud rate
   - 8 data bits
   - No parity
   - One stop bit
   - No flow control
3. Download the program to the target board.
4. Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
When the example runs successfully, the following message is displayed in the terminal:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Starting channel No.0 ...
 Channel No.0 interrupt is occurred !
 Channel No.0 interrupt is occurred !
 Channel No.0 interrupt is occurred !
 Channel No.0 interrupt is occurred !
 Channel No.0 interrupt is occurred !
