Overview
========
The PXP LCDIF hand shake project shows how to enable the hand shake between
PXP and LCDIF. If this example runs correctly, you will see two rectangles moving in the
screen. One rectangle is process surface output, and the other is alpha surface
output, the overlay region color is OR'ed value of process surface and alpha surface.

NOTE:
This example must run continously to get the right result, breaking during debug
will results to handshake fail. Because the PXP must be started before every LCD
frame, if system is halt, the PXP does not start correctly.

Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  9.3.1
- MCUXpresso  11.3.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- EVKB-IMXRT1050 board
- Personal Computer
- RK043FN02H-CT LCD board

Board settings
==============
1. Connect the RK043FN02H-CT board to J8.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a USB cable between the host PC and the OpenSDA USB port on the target board. 
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
When the demo runs successfully, the log would be seen on the OpenSDA terminal like:
