Overview
========
The lpuart_functioncal_interrupt example shows how to use lpuart driver functional
API to receive data with interrupt method:

In this example, one lpuart instance connect to PC, the board will
send back all characters that PC send to the board.

Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  9.3.1
- MCUXpresso  11.3.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- EVK-MIMXRT1060 board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
No special settings are required.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a USB cable between the host PC and the OpenSDA USB port on the target board.
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
When the demo runs successfully, the log would be seen on the OpenSDA terminal like:
