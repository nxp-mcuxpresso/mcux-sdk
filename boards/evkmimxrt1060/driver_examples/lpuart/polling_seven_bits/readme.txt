Overview
========
The lpuart_polling_seven_bits Example project is to demonstrate usage of the KSDK lpuart driver with seven data bits feature enabled.
In the example, you can send characters to the console back and they will be printed out onto console
 instantly.
NOTE: Please set com port format to "7 data bits without parity bit" in PC's com port tool
