Overview
========
The lpspi_edma_b2b_transfer example shows how to use LPSPI driver in edma way:

In this example , we need two boards, one board used as LPSPI master and another board used as LPSPI slave.
The file 'lpspi_edma_b2b_transfer_slave.c' includes the LPSPI slave code.

1. LPSPI master send/received data to/from LPSPI slave in edma . (LPSPI Slave using edma to receive/send the data)

Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  9.3.1
- MCUXpresso  11.3.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- EVK-MIMXRT1020 board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============

SPI one board:
Transfer data from one board instance to another board's instance.
SPI1 pins are connected with SPI1 pins of another board
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
       MASTER           connect to           SLAVE
Pin Name   Board Location     Pin Name    Board Location
SOUT       J19-4                SIN       J19-5
SIN        J19-5                SOUT      J19-4
SCK        J19-6                SCK       J19-6
PCS0       J19-3                PCS0      J19-3
GND        J19-7                GND       J19-7
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a mini USB cable between the PC host and the OpenSDA USB port on the board.
2.  Open a serial terminal on PC for OpenSDA serial device with these settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Reset the SoC and run the project.

Running the demo
================
When the demo runs successfully, the log would be seen on the OpenSDA terminal like:

Note:
To debug in qspiflash, following steps are needed:
1. Select the flash target and compile.
2. Set the SW8: 1 off 2 off 3 on 4 off, then power on the board and connect USB cable to J23.
3. Start debugging in IDE.
   - Keil: Click "Download (F8)" to program the image to qspiflash first then clicking "Start/Stop Debug Session (Ctrl+F5)" to start debugging.
