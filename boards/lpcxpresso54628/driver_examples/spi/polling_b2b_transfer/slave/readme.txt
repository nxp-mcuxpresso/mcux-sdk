Overview
========
The spi_polling_board2board_slave example shows how to use spi driver as slave to do board to board transfer with
polling:

Notice: The SPI slave of this example uses interrupt mode, as there is no polling mode for SPI slave.

In this example, one spi instance as slave and another spi instance on other board as master. Master sends a piece of
data to slave, and receive a piece of data from slave. This example checks if the data received from master is correct.

Toolchain supported
===================
- MCUXpresso  11.3.0
- GCC ARM Embedded  9.3.1

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- LPCXpresso54628 board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
Populate jumper JP6.
Connect SPI slave on board to SPI master on other board

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a micro USB cable between the PC host and the LPC-Link USB port (J8) on the board.
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Reset the SoC and run the project.

Running the demo
================
When the demo runs successfully, the log would be seen on the terminal like:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Slave is working....

Succeed!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
