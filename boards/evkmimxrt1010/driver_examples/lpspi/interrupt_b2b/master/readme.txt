Overview
========
The lpspi_interrupt_b2b example shows how to use LPSPI driver in interrupt way:

In this example , we need two boards , one board used as LPSPI master and another board used as LPSPI slave.
The file 'lpspi_interrupt_b2b_master.c' includes the LPSPI master code.
This example does not use the transactional API in LPSPI driver. It's a demonstration that how to use the interrupt in KSDK driver.

1. LPSPI master send/received data to/from LPSPI slave in interrupt . (LPSPI Slave using interrupt to receive/send the data)

Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  9.3.1
- MCUXpresso  11.3.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- Two EVK-MIMXRT1010 board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
SPI one board:
Transfer data from one board instance to another board's instance.
SPI1 pins are connected with SPI1 pins of another board
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
       MASTER           connect to           SLAVE
Pin Name   Board Location     Pin Name    Board Location
SOUT       J57-10             SIN         J57-8
SIN        J57-8              SOUT        J57-10
SCK        J57-12             SCK         J57-12
PCS0       J57-6              PCS0        J57-6
GND        J57-14             GND         J57-14
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a mini USB cable between the PC host and the OpenSDA USB port on the board.
2.  Open a serial terminal on PC for OpenSDA serial device with these settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Reset the SoC and run the project.

Running the demo
================
When the demo runs successfully, the log would be seen on the OpenSDA terminal like:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
lpspi_functional_interrupt_board_2_board_master start.
This example use one board as master and another as slave.
Master and slave uses interrupt way. Slave should start first. 
Please make sure you make the correct line connection. Basically, the connection is: 
LPSPI_master -- LPSPI_slave   
   CLK      --    CLK  
   PCS      --    PCS 
   SOUT     --    SIN  
   SIN      --    SOUT 
   GND      --    GND 

LPSPI transfer all data matched!

End of master example!

Note:
To debug in qspiflash, following steps are needed:
1. Select the flash target and compile.
2. Set the SW8: 1 off 2 off 3 on 4 off, then power on the board and connect USB cable to J41.
3. Start debugging in IDE.
   - Keil: Click "Download (F8)" to program the image to qspiflash first then clicking "Start/Stop Debug Session (Ctrl+F5)" to start debugging.
