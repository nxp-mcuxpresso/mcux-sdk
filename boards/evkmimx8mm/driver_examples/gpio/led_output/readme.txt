Overview
========
The GPIO Example project is a demonstration program that uses the KSDK software to manipulate the general-purpose
outputs.
The example is supported by the set, clear, and toggle write-only registers for each port output data register. The 
example take turns to shine the LED.


Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  9.3.1

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- MIMX8MM6-EVK  board
- J-Link Debug Probe
- 12V power supply
- Personal Computer
- Oscilloscope

Board settings
==============
Use oscilloscope to probe the signal on J1003-19 (On Base board).

#### Please note this application can't support running with Linux BSP! ####

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect 12V power supply and J-Link Debug Probe to the board, switch SW101 to power on the board
2.  Connect a USB cable between the host PC and the J901 USB port on the target board.
3.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
4.  Download the program to the target board.
5.  Launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
When the example runs successfully, the following message is displayed in the terminal:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
