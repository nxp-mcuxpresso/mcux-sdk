Overview
========
The spi_interrupt_b2b_slave example shows how to use spi functional API to do interrupt transfer as a slave:

In this example, the spi instance as slave. Slave receives data froma master and send a peiece of data to master,
and check if the data slave received is correct. This example needs to work with spi_interrupt_b2b_master example.

Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  9.3.1
- MCUXpresso  11.3.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini USB cable
- Two FRDM-KL27Z boards
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
SPI board to board:
Transfers data through SPI interface. SPI0 pins of the master board are
connected to the SPI1 pins of the slave board.

MASTER BOARD           CONNECTS TO         SLAVE BOARD
Pin Name   Board Location     Pin Name  Board Location
MOSI       J2 pin 8           MOSI      J2 pin 18
MISO       J2 pin 10          MISO      J2 pin 20
SCK        J2 pin 12          SCK       J1 pin 11
PCS0       J2 pin 6           PCS0      J1 pin 9

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a mini USB cable between the PC host and the OpenSDA USB port on the board.
2.  Open a serial terminal on PC for OpenSDA serial device with these settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Reset the SoC and run the project.

Running the demo
================
When the demo runs successfully, the log would be seen on the OpenSDA terminal like:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SPI board to board interrupt slave example started!

SPI transfer finished!
