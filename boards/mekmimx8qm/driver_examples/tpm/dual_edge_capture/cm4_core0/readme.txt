Overview
========
The TPM project is a demonstration program of the SDK TPM driver's dual-edge capture feature.
This feature is available only on certain SoC's.
The example sets up a TPM channel-pair for dual-edge capture. Once the input signal is received,
this example will print the capture values and period of the input signal on the terminal window.

Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  9.3.1

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- i.MX8QM MEK Board
- MCIMX8-8X-BB
- J-Link Debug Probe
- 12V power supply
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
- CM4_0: Connect input signal to J27-1(TPM CH0, On base board)

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect 12V power supply and J-Link Debug Probe to the board.
2.  Connect a USB cable between the host PC and the Debug port on the board (Refer "Getting Started with MCUXpresso SDK for i.MX 8QuadMax.pdf" for debug port information).
3.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
4.  Download the program to the target board (Please refer "Getting Started with MCUXpresso SDK for i.MX 8QuadMax.pdf" for how to run different targets).
5.  Launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the example.

Running the demo
================
When the example runs successfully, the following message is displayed in the terminal:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
TPM dual-edge capture example

Once the input signal is received the input capture values are printed

The input signal's pulse width is calculated from the capture values & printed

Capture value C(n)V=0

Capture value C(n+1)V=26d4

Input signals pulse width=82 us
