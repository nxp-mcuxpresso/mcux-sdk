Overview
========
The lpspi_interrupt_b2b example shows how to use LPSPI driver in interrupt way:

In this example , we need two boards , one board used as LPSPI master and another board used as LPSPI slave.
The file 'lpspi_interrupt_b2b_master.c' includes the LPSPI master code.
This example does not use the transactional API in LPSPI driver. It's a demonstration that how to use the interrupt in KSDK driver.

1. LPSPI master send/received data to/from LPSPI slave in interrupt . (LPSPI Slave using interrupt to receive/send the data)

Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  9.3.1

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- i.MX8QM MEK Board
- MCIMX8-8X-BB
- J-Link Debug Probe
- 12V power supply
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
SPI two boards:
Transfer data from one board's instance to another board's instance.
SPI2 pins are connected with SPI2 pins of another board
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
INSTANCE(SPI2)     CONNECTS TO         INSTANCE(SPI2)
Pin Name  Base Board Location  Pin Name  Base Board Location
SOUT        J29-6              SIN       J29-5
SIN         J29-5              SOUT      J29-6
SCK         J29-4              SCK       J29-4
PCS0        J29-3              PCS0      J29-3
GND         J29-8              GND       J29-8

#### Please note this application can't support running with Linux BSP! ####
This example aims to show the basic usage of the IP's function, some of the used Pads/Resources are also used by Cortex-A core.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect 12V power supply and J-Link Debug Probe to the board.
2.  Connect a USB cable between the host PC and the Debug port on the board (Refer "Getting Started with MCUXpresso SDK for i.MX 8QuadMax.pdf" for debug port information).
3.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
4.  Download the program to the target board (Please refer "Getting Started with MCUXpresso SDK for i.MX 8QuadMax.pdf" for how to run different targets).
5.  Launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the example.

Running the demo
================
When the example runs successfully, you can see the similar information from the terminal as below.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
lpspi_functional_interrupt_board_2_board_master start.
This example use one board as master and another as slave.
Master and slave uses interrupt way. Slave should start first. 
Please make sure you make the correct line connection. Basically, the connection is: 
LPSPI_master -- LPSPI_slave   
   CLK      --    CLK  
   PCS      --    PCS 
   SOUT     --    SIN  
   SIN      --    SOUT 
   GND      --    GND 

LPSPI transfer all data matched!
