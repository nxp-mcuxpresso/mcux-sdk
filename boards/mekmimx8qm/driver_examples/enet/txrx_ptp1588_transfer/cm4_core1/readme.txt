Overview
========

The enet_rxtx_ptp1588 example shows the way to use ENET driver to  
 receive and transmit frame in the 1588 feature required cases.

1. This example shows how to initialize the ENET MAC.
2. How to use ENET MAC to receive and transmit frame.
3. How to add to the multicast group to receive PTP 1588 message.
4. How to get the time stamp of the PTP 1588 timer.
4. How to use Get the ENET transmit and receive frame time stamp.

The example transmits 20 number PTP event frame, shows the timestamp of the transmitted frame.
The length, source MAC address and destination MAC address of the received frame will be print. 
The time stamp of the received timestamp will be print when the PTP message frame is received. 

Note, The RMII mode is used for default setting to initialize the ENET interface between MAC and the external PHY. you 
can change it to MII mode as you wish. Please make sure the MII Mode setting in the MAC is synchronize to the setting
in TWR-SERIAL board for the external PHY.

Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  9.3.1

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- i.MX8QM MEK CPU Board
- J-Link Debug Probe
- 12V power supply
- Loopback network cable RJ45 standard
- Network switch
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
J14 connected with network switch through RJ45 network cable.

#### Please note this application can't support running with Linux BSP! ####
This example aims to show the basic usage of the IP's function, some of the used Pads/Resources are also used by Cortex-A core.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect 12V power supply and J-Link Debug Probe to the board.
2.  Connect a USB cable between the host PC and the Debug port on the board (Refer "Getting Started with MCUXpresso SDK for i.MX 8QuadMax.pdf" for debug port information).
3.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
4.  Insert loopback network cable into network switch device(support loopback frames) and connect switch to board's Ethernet RJ45 port.
5.  Download the program to the target board (Please refer "Getting Started with MCUXpresso SDK for i.MX 8QuadMax.pdf" for how to run different targets).
6.  Launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the example.

Make loopback network cable:
      Standard 1	     Standard 2
J1    orange+white       green+white
J2    orange             green
J3    green+white        orange+white
J4    blue               brown+white
J5    blue+white         brown
J6    green              orange
J7	  brown+white        blue
J8    brown              blue+white

Connect J1 => J3, J2 => J6, J4 => J7, J5 => J8. 10/100M transfer only requires J1, J2, J3, J6, and 1G transfer requires all 8 pins.
Check your net cable color order and refer to the sheet above. If your cable's color order is not showed in the list,
please connect J1~J8 based on your situation.

Running the demo
================
When the demo runs, the log would be seen on the debug terminal like:

ENET PTP 1588 example start.

Get the 1-th time xx second xx nanosecond
........
Get the 10-th time xx second xx nanosecond

The 1 frame transmitted success! the timestamp is xx second, xx nanosecond
The 2 frame transmitted success! the timestamp is xx second, xx nanosecond
The 3 frame transmitted success! the timestamp is xx second, xx nanosecond
The 4 frame transmitted success! the timestamp is xx second, xx nanosecond
......
The 20 frame transmitted success! the timestamp is xx second, xx nanosecond

Note: the xx second and xx nanosecond should not be zero and should be number with solid increment.

when a 1000 length ptp event message frame is received, the log would be added to the terminal like:
A frame received. the length 1000 the timestamp is xx second, xx nanosecond
Dest Address xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx Src Address xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx
