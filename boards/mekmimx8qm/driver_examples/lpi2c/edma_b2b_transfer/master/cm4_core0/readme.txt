Overview
========
The lpi2c_edma_b2b_transfer_master example shows how to use lpi2c driver as master to do board to board transfer 
with EDMA:

In this example, one lpi2c instance as master and another lpi2c instance on the other board as slave. Master sends a 
piece of data to slave, and receive a piece of data from slave. This example checks if the data received from 
slave is correct.

Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  9.3.1

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- i.MX8QM MEK Board
- MCIMX8-8X-BB
- J-Link Debug Probe
- 12V power supply
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
LPI2C board to board example:
  + Transfer data from MASTER_BOARD to SLAVE_BOARD of LPI2C interface, LPI2C pins of MASTER_BOARD are connected with
    LPI2C pins of SLAVE_BOARD
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
MASTER_BOARD        CONNECTS TO         SLAVE_BOARD
Pin Name     Board Location     Pin Name     Board Location
LPI2C_SCL   J30-5              LPI2C_SCL     J30-5 
LPI2C_SDA   J30-6              LPI2C_SDA     J30-6 
GND         J30-8              GND           J30-8

#### Please note this application can't support running with Linux BSP! ####
This example aims to show the basic usage of the IP's function, some of the used Pads/Resources are also used by Cortex-A core.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect 12V power supply and J-Link Debug Probe to the board.
2.  Connect a USB cable between the host PC and the Debug port on the board (Refer "Getting Started with MCUXpresso SDK for i.MX 8QuadMax.pdf" for debug port information).
3.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
4.  Download the program to the target board (Please refer "Getting Started with MCUXpresso SDK for i.MX 8QuadMax.pdf" for how to run different targets).
5.  Launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the example.

Running the demo
================
When the example runs successfully, the following message is displayed in the terminal:

MASTER_BOARD will displayed:
