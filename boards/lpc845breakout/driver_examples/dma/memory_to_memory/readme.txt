Overview
========
The DMA memory to memory example is a simple demonstration program that uses the SDK software.
It executes one shot transfer from source buffer to destination buffer using the SDK DMA drivers.
The purpose of this example is to show how to use the DMA and to provide a simple example for
debugging and further development.

Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  9.3.1
- MCUXpresso  11.3.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- LPC845 Breakout board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
No special settings are required.

Prepare the demo
1.  Connect a micro USB cable between the PC host and the CMSIS DAP USB port on the board.
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 9600 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
The log below shows example output of the dma driver demo in the terminal window:
