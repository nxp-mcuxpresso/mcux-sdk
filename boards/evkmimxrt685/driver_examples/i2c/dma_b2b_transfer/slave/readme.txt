Overview
========
The i2c_dma_b2b_transfer_slave example shows how to use i2c driver as slave to do board to board transfer 
with a DMA master:

In this example, one i2c instance as slave and another i2c instance on the other board as master. Master sends a 
piece of data to slave, and receive a piece of data from slave. This example checks if the data received from 
slave is correct.

Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  9.3.1
- MCUXpresso  11.3.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- EVK-MIMXRT685 board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============

I2C one board:
  + Transfer data from MASTER_BOARD to SLAVE_BOARD of I2C interface, I2C4 pins of MASTER_BOARD are connected with
    I2C4 pins of SLAVE_BOARD
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
MASTER_BOARD        CONNECTS TO         SLAVE_BOARD
Pin Name   Board Location     Pin Name   Board Location
P0_29       J27-2               P0_29      J27-2
P0_30       J27-1               P0_30      J27-1
GND         J28-7               GND        J28-7
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a micro USB cable between the PC host and the CMSIS DAP USB port (J5) on the board
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
The following message shows in the terminal if the example runs successfully.
