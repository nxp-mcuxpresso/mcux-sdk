Overview
========

The CMP polling Example shows the simplest way to use CMP driver and help user with a quick start.

In this example, user should indicate an input channel to capture a voltage signal (can be controlled by user) as the 
CMP's positive channel input. On the negative side, the internal 6-bit DAC is used to generate the fixed voltage about
half value of reference voltage.

When running the project, change the input voltage of user-defined channel, then the comparator's output would change
between logic one and zero when the user's voltage crosses the internal DAC's value. The endless loop in main() function
would detect the logic value of comparator's output, and change the LED. The LED would be turned on when the compare
output is logic one, or turned off when zero.

Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  9.3.1
- MCUXpresso  11.3.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- FRDM-KV11Z board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
The connection should be set as following:
CMP0_IN3 (J4-11) to SW2 (J1-10)

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a USB cable between the host PC and the OpenSDA USB port on the target board.
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
When the example runs successfully, the following message is displayed in the terminal:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Then change CMP analog input by pushing the SW2 button, and watch the change of LED.
    - CMP0_IN3 (J4-11) connected to VCC =3.3V (SW2 released): LED RED on
    - CMP0_IN3 (J4-11) connected to GND (SW2 pushed): LED RED off
