Overview
========

The lpadc_single_interrupt example shows how to use interrupt with LPADC driver.

In this example, user should indicate a channel to provide a voltage signal (can be controlled by user) as the LPADC's
sample input. When running the project, typing any key into debug console would trigger the conversion. ADC watermark 
interrupt would be asserted once the number of datawords stored in the ADC Result FIFO is greater than watermark value.
In ADC ISR, the watermark flag would be cleared by reading the conversion result value. Also, result information would
be printed when the execution return to the main function.


Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  9.3.1

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- MCIMX7ULP-EVK board
- J-Link Debug Probe
- 5V power supply
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
The example uses CH6A(J11-7) as LPADC input.

#### Please note this application can't support running with Linux BSP! ####

Prepare the Demo
================
1. Connect 5V power supply and J-Link Debug Probe to the board, switch SW1 to power on the board.
2. Connect a micro USB cable between the host PC and the J6 USB port on the target board.
3. Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
4. Download the program to the target board.
5. Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the example.

Running the demo
================
When the demo runs successfully, following information can be seen on the terminal:
