Overview
========
The TPM project is a demonstration program of the SDK TPM driver's output compare feature.
It sets up one TPM channel to toggle the output when a match occurs with the channel value. The user
should probe the TPM output with a oscilloscope to see the signal toggling.

Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  9.3.1

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- MCIMX7ULP-EVK board
- J-Link Debug Probe
- 5V power supply
- Personal Computer
- Oscilloscope

Board settings
==============
Connect TP86(PTB0) to Oscilloscope channel 1.

#### Please note this application can't support running with Linux BSP! ####

Prepare the Demo
================
1. Connect 5V power supply and J-Link Debug Probe to the board, switch SW1 to power on the board.
2. Connect a micro USB cable between the host PC and the J6 USB port on the target board.
3. Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
4. Download the program to the target board.
5. Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the example.

Running the demo
================
When the example runs successfully, you can see information from the terminal as below.
