Overview
========
The LPIT single channel project is a simple example of the SDK LPIT driver. It sets up the LPIT
hardware block to trigger a periodic interrupt after every 1 second. When the LPIT interrupt is triggered
a message a printed on the serial terminal and an LED is toggled on the board.


Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  9.3.1

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- MCIMX7ULP-EVK board
- J-Link Debug Probe
- 5V power supply
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
No special settings are required.

#### Please note this application can't support running with Linux BSP! ####

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect 5V power supply and J-Link Debug Probe to the board, switch SW1 to power on the board.
2.  Connect a micro USB cable between the host PC and the J6 USB port on the target board.
3.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
4.  Download the program to the target board.
5.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the example.

Running the demo
================
When the example runs successfully, you can see the similar information from the terminal as below but you can't see LED toggled on the board
because there is no led connected on the MCIMX7ULP-EVK board .
