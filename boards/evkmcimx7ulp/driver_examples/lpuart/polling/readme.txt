Overview
========
The lpuart_polling Example project is to demonstrate usage of the KSDK lpuart driver.
In the example, you can send characters to the console back and they will be printed out onto console
 instantly.
Note: Please input one character at a time. If you input too many characters each time, the receiver may overflow
because the LPUART uses simple polling way for receiving.
