Overview
========
The flexio_lpi2c_interrupt example shows how to use flexio i2c master  driver in interrupt way:

In this example, a flexio simulated i2c master connect to a LPI2C slave

Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  9.3.1

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- MCIMX7ULP-EVK board
- J-Link Debug Probe
- 5V power supply
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
The example requires doing connection between FLEXIO pins and LPI2C pins.
Please use two dupontline to touch the test point (TP) on MCIMX7ULP-EVK base board as following:
- TP24, TP25 connected
- TP26, TP27 connected

#### Please note this application can't support running with Linux BSP! ####

#### Please note this application can only run well with RAM link file!
If run it in QSPI flash in place, there's high latency when instruction fetch cache miss. The FlexIO I2C
has critical timing requirement that I2C data must be read/write in time, otherwise the state machine works
abnormally. ####

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect 5V power supply and J-Link Debug Probe to the board, switch SW1 to power on the board.
2.  Connect a micro USB cable between the host PC and the J6 USB port on the target board.
3.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
4.  Download the program to the target board.
5.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the example

Running the demo
================
When the example runs successfully, you can see the similar information from the terminal as below.
