Overview
========
The i2c_dma_b2b_transfer_master example shows how to use i2c driver as master to do board to board transfer 
with DMA:

In this example, one i2c instance as master and another i2c instance on the other board as slave. Master sends a 
piece of data to slave, and receive a piece of data from slave. This example checks if the data received from 
slave is correct.

Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  9.3.1
- MCUXpresso  11.3.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- Two LPCXpresso55S69 boards
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
MASTER_BOARD        CONNECTS TO         SLAVE_BOARD
Pin Name   Board Location     Pin Name   Board Location
I2C_SCL    P17-1              I2C_SCL    P17-1
I2C_SDA    P17-3              I2C_SDA    P17-3
GND        P17-7              GND        P17-7

Prepare the Demo
================
Note: MCUXpresso IDE project default debug console is semihost
1. Connect a micro USB cable between the PC host and the LPC-Link USB port (P6) on the board.
2. Open a serial terminal on PC for JLink serial device with these settings:
   - 115200 baud rate
   - 8 data bits
   - No parity
   - One stop bit
   - No flow control
3. Download the program to the target board.
4. Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running
   the demo.

Running the demo
================
The following message shows in the terminal if the example runs successfully.
