Overview
========

The CMP interrupt Example shows how to use interrupt with CMP driver.

In this example, user should indicate an input channel to capture a voltage signal (can be controlled by user) as the 
CMP's positive channel input. On the negative side, the internal VREF ladder is used to generate the fixed voltage about
half value of reference voltage.

When running the project, change the input voltage of user-defined channel, then the comparator's output would change
between logic one and zero when the user-defined channel's voltage crosses the internal VREF's value. The change of
comparator's output would generate the falling and rising edge events with their interrupts enabled. When any CMP 
interrupt happens, the CMP's ISR would turn on the LED light if detecting the output's rising edge, or turn off it when
detecting the output's falling edge.

Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  9.3.1
- MCUXpresso  11.3.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- LPCxpresso55s69 board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
Connect a DC voltage source to P19_6 (PIO0_0/CMP IN1)

Prepare the Demo
================
Note: MCUXpresso IDE project default debug console is semihost
1.  Connect a macro USB cable between the PC host and the OpenSDA USB port on the board.
2.  Open a serial terminal on PC for OpenSDA serial device with these settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Reset the SoC and run the project.

Running the demo
================
When the demo runs successfully, the log would be seen on the OpenSDA terminal like:

CMP interrupt driver example.

Then change CMP analog input, and the LED GREEN will show the output of the comparator.
    - Let CMP IN1 voltage be higher than half of the VDDA, LED GREEN on.
    - Let CMP IN1 voltage be lower than half of the VDDA, LED GREEN off.
