Overview
========

The lpadc_interrupt example shows how to use interrupt with LPADC driver.

In this example, user should indicate a channel to provide a voltage signal (can be controlled by user) as the LPADC's
sample input. When running the project, typing any key into debug console would trigger the conversion. ADC watermark 
interrupt would be asserted once the number of datawords stored in the ADC Result FIFO is greater than watermark value.
In ADC ISR, the watermark flag would be cleared by reading the conversion result value. Also, result information would
be printed when the execution return to the main function.


Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  9.3.1
- MCUXpresso  11.3.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- LPCXpresso55s69 board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
- Connect a jumper to P15-2 and P15-3.
- ADC CH0A input signal P28-1(PIO0-23).

Prepare the Demo
================
Note: MCUXpresso IDE project default debug console is semihost
1.  Connect a micro USB cable between the PC host and the CMSIS DAP USB port (P6) on the board
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings (See Appendix A in Getting started guide for description how to determine serial port number):
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
The log below shows the output of the hello world demo in the terminal window:
