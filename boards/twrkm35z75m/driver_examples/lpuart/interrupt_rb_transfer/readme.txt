Overview
========
The lpuart_interrupt_ring_buffer Example project is to demonstrate usage of the KSDK lpuart driver.
In the example, you can send characters to the console back and they will be printed out onto console
 in a group of 8 characters.

Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  9.3.1
- MCUXpresso  11.3.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- TWR-KM35Z75M board
- Personal Computer
- USB to Com Converter

Board settings
==============
No special settings are required.

1.  Connect USB to Com Converter between the host PC and the port on the board.
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Reset the SoC and run the project.

Running the demo
================
When the example runs successfully, the log would be seen on the UART Terminal port which connected to the USB2COM like:
