Overview
========
The TPM project is a simple demonstration program of the SDK TPM driver to use TPM as a timer.
It sets up the TPM hardware block to trigger an interrupt every 1 millisecond.
When the TPM interrupt is triggered a message a printed on the UART terminal.

Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  9.3.1

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- FRDM-K32L3A6 board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
No special settings are required.

Prepare the Demo
================
1. Connect a USB cable between the host PC and the OpenSDA USB port on the target board.
2. Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3. Download the program to the target board.
4. Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the example.

Running the demo
================
When the example runs successfully, the following message is displayed in the terminal:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You will see a "-" or "|" in terminal every 1 second:
-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-
