Overview
========
The LPIT single channel project is a simple example of the SDK LPIT driver. It sets up the LPIT
hardware block to trigger a periodic interrupt after every 1 second. When the LPIT interrupt is triggered
a message a printed on the serial terminal and an LED is toggled on the board.


Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  9.3.1

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- MIMX8QX MEK board
- J-Link Debug Probe
- 12V power supply
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
No special settings are required.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect 12V power supply and J-Link Debug Probe to the board, switch SW3 to power on the board.
2.  Connect a micro USB cable between the host PC and the J11 USB port on the cpu board.
3.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
4.  Download the program to the target board.
5.  Launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the example.

Running the demo
================
When the example runs successfully, the following message is displayed in the terminal:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Starting channel No.0 ...
 Channel No.0 interrupt is occurred !
 Channel No.0 interrupt is occurred !
 Channel No.0 interrupt is occurred !
