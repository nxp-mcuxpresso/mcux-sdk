Overview
========
The uart_polling example shows how to use uart driver in polling way:

In this example, one uart instance connect to PC through uart, the board will send back all characters that PC
send to the board.

Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  9.3.1
- MCUXpresso  11.3.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini USB cable
- FRDM-K32L2B board
- Personal Computer
- USB to Com Converter

Board settings
==============
Connect pin:
- RX of USB2COM to J1_6
- TX of USB2COM to J2-4
- GND of USB2COM to J2-14

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect USB to Com Converter between the PC host and the port on the board.
2.  Open a serial terminal on PC for serial device with these settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Reset the SoC and run the project.

Running the demo
================
When the demo runs successfully, the log would be seen on the UART Terminal port which connected to the USB2COM like:
