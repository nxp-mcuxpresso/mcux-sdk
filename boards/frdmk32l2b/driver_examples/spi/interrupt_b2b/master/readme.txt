Overview
========
The spi_interrupt_b2b_master example shows how to use spi functional API to do interrupt transfer as a master:

In this example, the spi instance as master. Master sends a piece of data to slave, receive data from slave,and check
if the data master received is correct. This example needs to work with spi_interrupt_b2b_slave example.

Toolchain supported
===================
- GCC ARM Embedded  9.3.1
- MCUXpresso  11.3.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini USB cable
- Two FRDM-K32L2B boards
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
SPI board to board:
Transfers data through SPI interface. SPI0 pins of the master board are
connected to the SPI1 pins of the slave board.

MASTER BOARD           CONNECTS TO         SLAVE BOARD
Pin Name   Board Location     Pin Name  Board Location
MISO       J1 pin 11          MISO      J2 pin 10
MOSI       J1 pin 9           MOSI      J2 pin 8
SCK        J1 pin 15          SCK       J2 pin 12
PCS0       J1 pin 7           PCS0      J2 pin 6
GND        J2 pin 14          GND       J2 pin 14

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a mini USB cable between the PC host and the OpenSDA USB port on the board.
2.  Open a serial terminal on PC for OpenSDA serial device with these settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Reset the SoC and run the project.

Running the demo
================
When the demo runs successfully, the log would be seen on the OpenSDA terminal like:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SPI board to board interrupt master example started!

SPI transfer finished!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
